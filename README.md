# Lab 8 - Starter

1) Within a Github actions whenever code is pushed.

It's easier for me to explain why the other 2 aren't ideal. 
We can't run them after all development is done because that would contradict the "iterative testing" that Agile promotes.
Running them locally is probably fine a first ("feel the hate before you automate"), but ultimately, we want to automate testing to speed up development.


2) No. When testing just an individual function, we use unit tests. UI tests are for testing a larger scope.
